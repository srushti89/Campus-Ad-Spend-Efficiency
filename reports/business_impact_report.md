# üìä Campus Ad Spend Efficiency - Business Impact Report

**Executive Summary: Optimizing Marketing Budget Through Data-Driven Attribution Analysis**

---

## üéØ Project Overview

**Objective**: Analyze multi-channel advertising data to optimize budget allocation and improve conversion efficiency across campus marketing campaigns.

**Analysis Period**: January 2024 - December 2024  
**Total Ad Spend Analyzed**: $2.1M  
**Conversion Events**: 15,847  
**Channels Analyzed**: 8 major advertising channels  

---

## üìà Key Findings

### 1. Channel Performance Insights

**Top Performing Channels (by Efficiency Score):**
1. **Google Search** - 4.2x ROAS, 8.1% conversion rate
2. **YouTube** - 3.8x ROAS, 5.2% conversion rate  
3. **Instagram** - 3.1x ROAS, 3.5% conversion rate

**Underperforming Channels:**
- **Display Network** - 1.9x ROAS, 1.5% conversion rate
- **TikTok** - 2.4x ROAS, 3.0% conversion rate

### 2. Pareto Analysis Results

**Critical Discovery**: 20% of ad placements are responsible for **62% of total conversions**

- Top 40 placements (out of 200 total) generate majority of results
- Significant opportunity for budget reallocation
- Long-tail placements showing poor efficiency

### 3. Attribution Model Comparison

**Multi-Touch Attribution Reveals Hidden Value:**

| Channel | Last-Touch | Linear | Position-Based | Time-Decay | Variance |
|---------|------------|--------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Google Search | $425k | $388k | $406k | $415k | 3.2% |
| Facebook | $287k | $245k | $267k | $252k | 6.8% |
| Instagram | $165k | $158k | $162k | $159k | 2.1% |

**Key Insight**: Facebook shows highest attribution variance (6.8%), suggesting complex multi-touch journeys that last-touch attribution undervalues.
